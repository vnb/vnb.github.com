      <description>Introduction to SVM Support Vector Machines are the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms for classification problems. This post discusses the mathematics/intuition behind Linear SVM algorithms with a light introduction to Lagrange multipliers which is used for the optimization part.
Linear SVM: In a 2-D space there are 2 sets of points represented by their coordinates (x1, x2) and their labels represented by y with values 1 or -1.</description>

      <description>I am a data scientist with background in chemical engineering. In my previous job, I worked with large amounts of sensor data, created dashboards for multiple hydrocarbon storage wells and made technical recommendations. This helped to optimize operating costs and also avert technical malfunctions. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for programming and statistics.
Around the same time I began to learn more about data science through a various online resources and then putting them to test by tackling kaggle challenges.</description>
