		<p>I am a data scientist with background in chemical engineering. In my previous job, I worked with large amounts of sensor data, created dashboards for multiple hydrocarbon storage wells and made technical recommendations. This helped to optimize operating costs and also avert technical malfunctions. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for programming and statistics.</p>

<p>Around the same time I began to learn more about data science through a various online resources and then putting them to test by tackling kaggle challenges. My education and experience as an engineer has counted towards quickly acquiring the skills necessary to be a good data scientist.</p>

<p>Recently I worked with DataKind to analyze Glideâ€™s diagnostics and treatment data for Hep-C from 2016 through 2018. As a part of this project our team worked on understanding key metrics which informed about the progress of patients along the service cascade (first appointment to treatment completion).</p>
