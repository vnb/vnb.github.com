        <p>
            Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data Cohorts are groups of users who signed up for a service at different points within an observed period. In the case of a superstore with data spanning for 4 years, a cohort index is a function of the month and year when they signed up. In order to perform a cohort analysis, we identify cohorts based on the time of sign-up for a service and by selecting metrics such as retention rates, profits etc to track cohorts over time.

            Introduction to SVM Support Vector Machines are the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms for classification problems. This post discusses the mathematics/intuition behind Linear SVM algorithms with a light introduction to Lagrange multipliers which is used for the optimization part.
Linear SVM: In a 2-D space there are 2 sets of points represented by their coordinates (x1, x2) and their labels represented by y with values 1 or -1.

        <p>
            I am a data scientist with background in chemical engineering. In my previous job, I worked with large amounts of sensor data, created dashboards for multiple hydrocarbon storage wells and made technical recommendations. This helped to optimize operating costs and also avert technical malfunctions. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for programming and statistics.
Around the same time I began to learn more about data science through a various online resources and then putting them to test by tackling kaggle challenges.

        <p>
            Fraud detection
Most transactions on the internet take place through the use of credit/debit cards in order to complete a purchase. While most transactions are legitimately initiated by a customer, a small fraction of these transactions are fraudulent. Fraudulent transactions amount to 0.1% of all transactions but the losses from such activities could run upto billions of dollars per year. Therefore, it is important for e-commerce sites and banks likewise to be able to identify fraudulent behavior in a timely manner and in order to do this we can employ machine learning methods.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            A funnel tracks all users from the first point of engagement with site to the last point for taking an action. For example, in an e-commerce, a new user will go through the landing page/home-page first, search for a relevant item for purchase, go to the confirmation page and then complete the purchase. Every website spends significant amount of money acquiring those customers through various advertising and marketing channels and their ultimate goal is to increase the conversion rate for these users.
