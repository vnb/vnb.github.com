		<p>A funnel tracks all users from the first point of engagement with site to the last point for taking an action. For example, in an e-commerce, a new user will go through the landing page/home-page first, search for a relevant item for purchase, go to the confirmation page and then complete the purchase. Every website spends significant amount of money acquiring those customers through various advertising and marketing channels and their ultimate goal is to increase the conversion rate for these users.
In order to achieve this goal, websites continuously understand their user behavior, identify bottlenecks in user interaction with the website and implement changes to the website based on data driven decision. Funnel analysis is one such methods to identify bottle necks in conversion rate and provide insights to optimize the same.
For example, lets look at the following dataset. After performing merge operations on user information and page visit information we see the following data set.</p>

<p><img src="/img/Funnel Analysis 1.png" alt="Sample dataset" />
In its totality, user engagement within the site looks like this:
<img src="/img/Funnel Analysis 2.png" alt="Sample dataset" />
But if we choose to see the same data separatelt for desktop and mobile, we get to see a few nuances:
<img src="/img/Funnel Analysis 3.png" alt="Sample dataset" /> <img src="/img/Funnel Analysis 4.png" alt="Sample dataset" />
Firstly, we have more datapoints for users on desktop than in mobile. However, distribution wise, we don&rsquo;t see any drastic difference visually. A simple groupby operation with pandas yeilds the follwing result:
<img src="/img/Funnel Analysis 5.png" alt="Sample dataset" />
Conversion rate overall is abysmally low for both desktop and mobile. Mobile conversion rates are marginally better but it can still be improved. There is a sudden drop-off of users after reaching the search page. In this particular dataset we only have data from January to April. It might help to visualize how conversion rates have fared during this time period.
<img src="/img/Funnel Analysis 6.png" alt="Sample dataset" />
<img src="/img/Funnel Analysis 7.png" alt="Sample dataset" />
As we can see, there has been a decline in conversion rate for both desktop and mobile with a slight pick up by April for desktop. To understand this decline we must ask certain questions.
* Were there any changes made to the website?
* Did the range of products change during this time?
* Were there any discounts that were initially made available which might have helped converting more users?</p>

<p>It is possible that these changes might have affected the way users interact with the site. However, the biggest bottle-neck that still needs to be addressed is the conversion from search page to payments page. Its important that the search feature yields the most relevant results. It would be helpful to understand the efficiency of the search by implementing a feedback questionnaire with a very simple question asking how relevant their search was and how satisfied they are with the results. Secondly, the price of items after the user uses the search feature might deter the user from taking the next step which is to reach the payments page.
Finally, once the above questions have been answered the website may begin implementing changes within the website in order to improve conversion rate. While the above analysis is preliminary, additional data about the user might help with understanding user engagement and preferences.</p>
