<h3 id="data-source-https-www-kaggle-com-jr2ngb-superstore-data">Data Source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data">https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data</a></h3>

<p>Cohorts are groups of users who signed up for a service at different points within an observed period. In the case of a superstore with data spanning for 4 years, a cohort index is a function of the month and year when they signed up. In order to perform a cohort analysis, we identify cohorts based on the time of sign-up for a service and by selecting metrics such as retention rates, profits etc to track cohorts over time.</p>

<p>Cohort Month and Cohort year refers to the first time a user placed an order through this website(the respective year and month).  Cohort Index is a function of Order Date and Cohort Date.</p>

<p>Cohort Index = (Order Year -  Cohort Year) * 12 + Order Month - Cohort Month + 1</p>

<p>Once the cohort index is calculated, orders related data can be grouped based on the Cohort Index and Cohort Month to visualize profitability, order quantities, signup rates etc. This kind of analysis is helpful to understand which cohort is most valuable and most profitable.</p>

<p>People who signup in the first month of the year have the highest retention rates. These cohorts are most likely purpose driven and tend to make many purchases during the course of the year

<p>This analysis shows that almost all cohorts order in large quantities during the second half of the year. This makes sense since holiday season begins around October and that total number of orders is highest during october

<p>Higher profits can be observed as a consequennce of all cohorts ordering larger quantities during the holidays season

<p>Instead of looking at all cohorts in the 4 year period we can make the same kind of analysis as above for just 2014. The result is pretty must the same: most activity in terms total orders and large order quanities and comparitively higher profits can observed between October - December.

Another important analysis we can make is the observe the discounts applied on orders. Based on the cohort analysis for the average discount metric, most discounts were applied during October and November. Not surprisingly, this coincides with the beginning of the holiday season.
